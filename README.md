## INTREST IN THE FEILD OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

### What is your interest in IT?
My interest in IT is web design and technical support. This is because the looks and coding of websites look very interesting and seeing it be used will be so satisfying to me. Technical support is basically the job at my own house already as my parents being older and coming from Vietnam, do not understand technology like I do so anything that happens that affects technology it is up to me to fix it.

### When did your interest in IT start? 
My interest in IT started when my older cousin brought over his laptop to my house and I started playing games on it, following that I got a WII console and then a Xbox. Having all these consoles made me interested in IT and then moving onto having my own PC. I just watched youtube videos about everything IT but more focusing on how to make a PC and how it runs.

### Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
My older cousin brought over his laptop and when I got my first consoles and PC it was the start of everything for me.

### Outline your IT experience (if any)
The only IT experience I have is completing Software development in Year 12 VCE and also the hundreds of videos I have watched but other than that I haven't had any actual practical or professional experience in the IT field.

### Why did you choose to come to RMIT? 
I chose to go to RMIT as it has a lot of amazing outlets and careers that can derive from going to this school as it has such a good reputation as a school. My friends also go here and recommend this school over all the ones. RMIT is something I see as something I will graduate from.

### What do you expect to learn during your studies?
I expect to learn a little of everything in the field of IT and when I have had a taste of everything I would then choose to dive deeper into the subject that sparks my interest the most.

### Description of the job and appel:
This job allows me to work at one of the biggest technology chains in the whole of Melbourne. In this job you are working both practical and hardware within a computer and laptop as you are working troubleshooting and repairing what is wrong with what is brought upon you. This job also is talking to customers and explaining what was wrong with their laptop and how you fixed it as well. This job is appealing to me because PC and laptop troubleshooting and repairing has always been an interest for me and with such a good company like Centrecom as well, it will allow me to learn from more experienced people than me and also build my foundation and knowledge into computers and the world of IT even more. The job seems also very fun as I am working around one of my biggest interests and being able to fix something from your own knowledge gives me a rush of excitement. ALso by working at Centrecom I can move into building PCs which to me is a dream job.

### Skills required:
The skills needed for this job include a distinctive knowledge of what can go wrong in a PC or laptop and being able to recognize and fix either the hardware, firmware or software issue that it would have. Another skill Centrecom wants you to have is good communication skills and being able to communicate with customers so that both parties understand what is happening.

### Skills that I have:
Skills that I have right now are good communication skills and working with people, as I have obtained a certificate 3 in Community service which we did a whole semester of how to communicate to different people in different scenarios. Moving onto the knowledge of troubleshooting and repairing PC and laptops, I feel like I have a basic knowledge and very ametuer experience in this field. Only things I have really troubleshooted and fixed are my PC and things for my dad so it's very ametuer.

### How can I obtain these skills:
I don't feel like there is really any other way besides working for a small business that can teach me and I can work for them to be able to learn new things and actually work with customers. The internet and especially youtube is also a very useful tool which I use currently to learn how to troubleshoot PCs and repair them the best way possible. In the end though, working at Centrecom and basically begging for the job to learn everything would be the most beneficial as I could learn alot and apply my base knowledge to fix the easiest PCs and move my way up from there.

## PERSONAL PROFILE:
### Results of an online Myers-Briggs test: 
The result I got from the Myers-Briggs test was Virtuoso.

### Results of an online learning style test: 
http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtm

The result I got from this test is that I am a tactile learner

### Results of one further online test of your choosing (A Big 5 Personality quiz)
https://scienceofpeople.typeform.com/to/k55Rcc

OCEAN is what the big 5 acronym is and OCEAN stands for openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. For all 5 of these I got low for all of them.

### What do the results of these tests mean for you? 
These results for me if I am being honest do not mean anything for me at all. That is because I do not believe in these tests to be 100% accurate to the person that is taking them, although it is just a general idea of the person, it means nothing to me at all as a person can change easily from one personality to the other. It shows me that the Virtuoso loves to learn with his hands building things, although that is sometimes true for me. Some days I rather just sit back and let my brain do the work. Overall these tests mean nothing to me and I just live with my personality day to day.

### How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
According to the Myer-Briggs test I am an introvert which means I rather work by myself and keep to myself which is true when I meet new people or in a new environment where I do not know anyone but when I get more comfrotabl;e and come out of my shell around the people I work with I rather do group work and talk to everyone as I am comfortable with them. So these results show that I rather work to myself which is true to an extent but when knowing everyone I would rather work with people.

### How should you take this into account when forming a team?
When forming groups I do not mind which personality I am with because all I expect from my group members is doing the work and if I could see myself being friends with them outside a professional environment. In group work I also do not like being the leader and I would rather let someone else do it so I would also consider someone who likes to lead to be in a group.

## PROJECT IDEA: LIGHTWEIGHT
### Overview 
My project idea is called LightWeight. LightWeight will be a mobile app that is used to track and monitor your workouts to keep you on track on your way to your fitness goals. The gym is always having new people come in who have no idea what they are doing and with this app, it will allow them to have basically everything they need to get started such as videos on exercises, workout plans and everyday basic information. This app will also push you harder as it will send constant notifications and motivational messages to you pushing you to get where you want to be and become a better person.

### Motivation
LightWeight would be useful as many people who actually end up buying a gym membership and then lack the motivation to go or are just not as knowledgeable in what they are doing. In America alone 67% of gym memberships are unused due to many factors with one of them being knowledge and lack of motivation. The average cost in Australia for a gym membership being 95 dollars a week is just draining money out of people's pockets but with LightWeight they can gain more knowledge and motivation so that that money does not go to waste. 

### Description
One of the main details of LightWeight is the workout plans that it offers for people depending on certain factors. These factors include what they are in the gym for such as building muscles and getting leaner or building just straight up muscle mass and getting stronger, how many days you are going to the gym, how long you will stay in the gym and current height and weight. Another feature that LightWeight will have is an inbuilt BMI calculator and inbuilt calorie calculator. Although both calculators do not detail 100% facts for the user it is a good feature to add as it gives a close estimate for what the user needs or is. Another feature in the app will be the motivational videos. These videos would be set into categories such as when you have to overcome something or you are trying to get hyped up for something. These videos all though will cater towards a more fitness and gym setting other users can just download the app to get their motivations for anything in life. Another main feature of this app is the pop up notifications that it gives you. These will be different from the normal ones that you get as they will pop up motivational quotes everyday and keep notifying you to go get better and go to the gym which might be annoying to the user but to have that constant reminder would show the user and hopefully motivate them to achieve their goals. Another feature of the LightWeight app is giving the location and prices of gyms that are nearby to you by using google maps. With this feature as well you can pick your favourite gym chain where it will also send you notifications of deals and promotions going on from that gym if their membership expires or if they are just looking for a gym to go to away from home. Another feature of LightWeight will be information and recommendation of products and supplements such as protein, creatine and pre workout. Supplements are something that many people are confused about and by providing information, videos and recommendations of the best products for what you need. One final feature of this app would be the personal trainer premium service. This would be a paid feature of the app where you can hire a personal trainer virtually or a meet up one so you can get a better understanding about yourself and have that one on one time that you need if you are not confident on what to do. A final small touch that the app will have is a widget feature showing you how many steps you have taken for the day giving you daily averages and advice on how to get your steps in more efficiently. This feature will be done from the data share of the health app from your IOS device.     

### Tools and Technologies 
The technology needed is an IPhone running IOS as it is the main software that the app will be available on and also a PC or laptop to make and download the program. To actually program the app you would need Swift which is a powerful programming language for everything related to Apple and their IOS systems and using this can also link the things such as the steps on the Health app to the program so users can track their steps as well. One last tool is people. This is because by surveying users before actually making and releasing the app it will allow you to go back to make any necessary changes.

### Skills Required 
The skills required for this project is a clear knowledge of how most coding and programming works as programming something for a phone would be much different than programming for a computer program. Another skill needed is being able to actually transfer the code onto your phone and get the app up and running while also paying Apple a fee when everything is done to even release the app onto their App Store. Other skills required is actually learning how to use Swift and the language they use which is C or C++. When it comes to the feasibility of learning these skills it is pretty low cost as there are many youtube videos and internet blogs with images to teach you how to do everything step by step even uploading the app to the app store.

### Outcome 
If the project is successful, the outcome I hope to see come out of this app are more people achieving their fitness goals no matter what they are trying to achieve. Another outcome is just people being more motivated to chase their dreams and get them to love themselves and just be confident. If people are more confident and motivated to go gyms as well, people will not waste their money and gym memberships leaving them in the dust. Overall this app will just try to shine a bright light in this dark world by allowing people to be more confident and motivated in achieving what they want in life.
